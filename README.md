## Intro

The NBA is an ever-evolving league in terms of strategy, talent, and even rules of the game. The most noticeable paradigm shift in recent times is the 3 point shooting movement. In the past decade from the 2011-12 season to the 2021-22 season, the number of 3 point shots attempted increased about 91% while overall field goals increased only about 8%. There has evidently been a 3 point revolution, led by players such as Steph Curry, James Harden, and Damian Lillard. Teams such as the Warriors and Houston were among the first to highly value different archetypes of players who fit into this revolution.

This research project aims to achieve the below goals related to understanding the constantly shifting dynamics of the NBA better:

Cluster players by box score stats and advanced statistics to identify modern player archetypes
Deep-dive into archetypes, their differences, and how their importance has changed over time in the NBA
Use a machine learning approach to predict team win rates on a monthly basis using the composition of the team (in terms of minutes allocated to each archetype) as features

By completing the above, we aim to understand how different archetypes of players have contributed to team success and what trends there have been in the value of each archetype. Practically, this research could have implications for team general managers as they decide how to value players on their team or players they are looking to acquire in the context of their entire team composition.
